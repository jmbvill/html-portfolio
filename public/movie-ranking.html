    <h1>The best Marvel movies and shows this year according to Josh</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Marvel stories that came out in 2023</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
    <p>I love how this movie gave all the characters a great send-off during their last movie.</p>

    <h3>Loki Season 2</h3>
    <p>I love how they showed the culmination of Loki's characterization ever since he first debuted in Thor.</p>

    <h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
    <p>The animation style for this movie was just beautiful!</p>

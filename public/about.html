    <h2>About Josh</h2>
    <p>Josh Villaflor has worked Passion Planner since 2020. He started off as a temporary Customer Success Agent, hired as a seasonal worker to help deal with a huge amount of tickets from the holiday season of 2019 - 2020. He eventually worked his way to becoming a permanent employee and then eventually the Lead of the whole Customer Success Team.</p>

    <p>As the Customer Success Lead at Passion Planner, he manages a small, internationl team of Customer Success Agents (CSAs) spread out over 3 time zones. His main goal during most of the year is to build up systems and tools to make sure his Customer Success Agents can properly help out Passion Planner's customers with all their questions and concerns.</p> 
    
    <p>However, starting in Q4 of every year, the busy season starts for the team. During this time, the number of CSAs under Josh doubles with the addition of temp workers, and the inquiries from customers usually skyrocket in quantity. When Q4 hits, the CS team must fall back on the systems that Josh has built. His main responsibilities during this time become a complicated dance of supporting his CSAs in their day-to-day and scheduling hours efficiently to avoid being wasting the CSAs time and company money.</p>

    <p>Fueled by the universal late night/early morning drive to improve one's life, Josh recently decided that he wanted to learn how to develop websites. His end goal is to become a Freelance Web Developer as a way to supplement his income and do things like save for retirement, plan a wedding, and buy his dog more toys.</p>

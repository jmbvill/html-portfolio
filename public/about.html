    <h2>About Josh</h2>
    <p>Josh Villaflor has been an integral part of Passion Planner since 2020. Starting out as a temporary Customer Success Agent, he joined as a seasonal worker to tackle the influx of tickets during the 2019-2020 holiday season. Over time, he worked his way up to a permanent role and eventually rose to a leadership position as the Lead of the entire Customer Success Team.</p>

    <p>As the Customer Success Lead at Passion Planner, Josh skillfully manages a compact, international team of Customer Success Agents (CSAs) across three different time zones. For the majority of the year, his main focus is establishing robust systems and tools to empower CSAs in assisting Passion Planner's valued customers with their inquiries and concerns.</p> 
        
    <p>However, as Q4 rolls around each year, the team faces an intensified workload. During this critical period, the number of CSAs under Josh's management doubles with the addition of temporary staff, and customer inquiries skyrocketing. Josh's methodical groundwork takes the spotlight during Q4 as the CS team relies on the systems he has meticulously crafted. His responsibilities evolve into a sophisticated choreography of supporting CSAs in their day-to-day activities and optimizing schedules to ensure efficiency while avoiding unnecessary time and resources expenditure.</p>

    <p>Fueled by the universal drive for personal advancement that all humankind feels on sleepless nights, Josh recently started on a journey to learn and master web development skills. His ultimate goal is to become a Freelance Web Developer, as a way to supplement his income and do things like save for retirement, plan a wedding, and buy more toys for his dog.</p>
